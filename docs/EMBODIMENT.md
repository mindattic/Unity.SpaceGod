You can take charge of anything man-made: jump into the helm of any ship, a turret on a hull or a
station, a satellite, then hand it back to its AI. Or you can leave it all to play out. This page sets
out the extension point that makes that possible without a separate piloting path for each kind of
thing.

## The extension point

Everything the player can take charge of implements one interface, `IEmbodiable`
(`Assets/UnitySpace/Core/Embodiment/Embodiment.cs`):

| Member | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `Name`, `Kind`, `Faction` | What it is and whose it is. `Kind` is an `EmbodimentKind`: `Ship`, `Fighter`, `Turret`, `Station`, `Satellite`. It is used for display and grouping only. Code never branches on it to decide how control works. |
| `Host` | The embodiable it is mounted on (a turret's ship or station), or null for a free hull. Hand-back and the "move up to the hull" control use it. |
| `CanEmbody` / `Blocker` | Whether the player can take it now, and if not, why ("destroyed", "derelict", "taken as a prize", "not a gun mount"). The only real blockers are a wreck, a hull that has been taken, and a thing that has nothing to control. |
| `PoseAt(jd)` | Where it is and which way it faces: an `EmbodimentPose` (frame body, km offset from that body's centre, forward, up). This is the same frame-body-plus-offset convention the pilot loop and the battles already use. |
| `TakeCharge()` | The player takes it. Its AI lets go: the fleet stops scheduling it, the battle stops working it. |
| `Control(input, dt)` | One frame of player input (`EmbodimentInput`: an aim direction, throttle, strafe, roll and two triggers), already turned into world terms by the Runtime's input layer. Each kind reads the parts it has: a turret reads aim and trigger, a hull reads all of it. |
| `HandBack()` | Its AI picks up from wherever the player left it, with the same pose and the same target picture. Nothing snaps back to a stale schedule. |

`EmbodimentSession` (`Core/Embodiment/EmbodimentSession.cs`) holds the one thing the player is
embodying. `Switch(next)` hands the current thing back before it takes the next, so changing seat is
always a hand-back followed by a take-charge. `Step(input, dt)` sends input on to the current thing,
or hands it back by itself once `CanEmbody` stops being true (shot away, captured). The session never
looks at `Kind`, so a new kind of controllable thing needs a new `IEmbodiable` and nothing else.

`Embodiables` (`Core/Embodiment/Embodiables.cs`) is where the things exist: the mountable guns on a
battle unit, and later the stations and satellites in a system. A picker UI lists from it and never
builds its own list.

## What implements it today

* **`ShipHelm` (Kind `Ship`).** This is the existing ship piloting behind the interface with nothing
  changed. Its eligibility check (`CanEmbody`), its starting frame (`FrameOf`), and its take-charge
  and hand-back bookkeeping (`World.PilotedShip`, an escort cut loose from its formation, the war's
  command handed over, a fighting hull's `BattleUnit` switched between the player and its crew) are
  the code `UnitySpaceApp` already ran. They have been moved into Core, and the Runtime now calls
  them. The hull's flight is still stepped by the Runtime's pilot loop (`PilotFlight.Step` and
  `PilotTuning`) because per-class flight models are being reworked under U.SPC-T17. `ShipHelm.Control`
  hands the trigger and the crosshair to the battle unit, as the pilot loop does now. Moving flight
  behind `Control` is follow-up work, to be done once T17 has landed.
* **`MountedTurret` (Kind `Turret`).** This is new. Any direct-fire gun mount (laser, heavy laser,
  autocannon, railgun, point defence, auto turret) on any `BattleUnit` can be taken: a ship's battery,
  a settlement's defence platform (today's stand-in for a station), or a gate fort. While it is held,
  the battle's `Fire` hands that one mount to `Battle.FireManned`. The mount traverses toward the
  player's aim at its own rate, stays inside its firing arc (a spinal railgun only within its gimbal),
  and fires down its barrel when the trigger is held. Every shot is a real aimed shot that hits only
  what it passes through (`ResolveShot`, the same path the player's nose guns use). Every other mount
  on the hull goes on firing under its crew, and hand-back returns this one to them. Nothing else
  about the host changes. Its own AI (or the player at its helm) keeps flying it.
* **`FighterSeat` (Kind `Fighter`, U.SPC-T422).** The cockpit of any fighter or bomber a carrier has
  launched into a fight. While it is held, the battle's step flies that one craft through
  `FighterAI.FlyManned` (on its entry in `Battle.Flown`) instead of its pilot's AI: the nose turns
  toward the stick at the craft's own turn rate, the throttle sets the share of its top speed it holds
  along the nose, its guns fire down the crosshair through the battle's usual player-gun path, and the
  secondary trigger looses a bomber's torpedoes at the hostile hull nearest its nose. Every gunner on
  the other side lays real aimed shots on it, as on any hull the player flies. If it led its squadron,
  its wingmen keep flying on it. Handed back, its pilot starts a fresh approach from where it was left
  on a target it picks then. A held craft never lands on its own, so it does not hold the fight open:
  the fight ends when the rest have landed, and the war takes it back aboard with them.

## Taking charge from the strategy view (U.SPC-T422)

`Embodiables.SeatsIn(world, battle)` lists every seat in a fight that can be taken now (each ship's
helm, each launched craft's cockpit) and `Embodiables.Cycle` steps through such a list. Gun mounts,
many to a hull, are reached from their hull (`Embodiables.TurretsOn(world, battle, unit)`).

In the game (`Runtime/UnitySpaceApp.Embodiment.cs`), from the strategy view, ' takes the seat in the
fight in view that is nearest the middle of the screen. After that, ' and ; step to the next and
previous seat in the same fight. / mans the next gun on the hull being flown or the one selected, and
after the last gun it goes back up to the hull's helm. P hands any seat back to its AI and returns to
command, restoring the commander's time warp and whatever the camera was following. A ship's helm is
still flown by the pilot loop. Every other seat is held in one `EmbodimentSession`, with the mouse
swinging the stick and the chase view following it. A seat that stops being embodiable (shot down,
the fight over) returns the player to command, and the session's `EndedBecause` gives the reason.

Nothing pauses and nothing loads. Taking a seat drops the clock to real time, which is a speed and
not a pause. The camera glides from seat to seat. Every seat not held stays under its own AI the
whole time. When the player takes nothing, the galaxy runs fully on its own.

## What follows (filed as `part-of U.SPC-T18`)

* U.SPC-T445, a Runtime turret seat: pick a mount on the selected or flown hull, a turret camera at the mount, and
  aim and fire from it.
* U.SPC-T446, a picker and switch UI: list embodiables near the camera or on the selected thing (from
  `Embodiables`), and jump between seats. U.SPC-T422 has added keyboard switching from the strategy view
  without pausing (above). A visible list to pick from is still to come.
* U.SPC-T447, stations as embodiables: a station hull with its own pose. It does not move, but it can turn its
  guns and launch its craft.
* U.SPC-T448, satellites as embodiables: an orbiting body you can turn and point (sensors, relays), with
  station-keeping thrust.
* U.SPC-T449, every ship role at the helm: freighters, miners, couriers and escorts all flown through `ShipHelm`
  with a sensible control set for their role, and ship flight moved behind `ShipHelm.Control` once
  U.SPC-T17's per-class flight models have landed.

## Rules for a new kind

1. Implement `IEmbodiable`. Keep the AI that holds the thing when the player doesn't inside that
   thing's own system (fleet, battle, station logic). `TakeCharge` and `HandBack` only flip who holds
   it.
2. Register where it can be found in `Embodiables`.
3. Add Core tests: it can be taken, it obeys input while taken, its AI resumes after hand-back, and
   it is dropped when it can no longer be embodied.
4. Never add a `switch` on `EmbodimentKind` to the session, the pilot loop or the picker.
