    // braces for a broadside and damage control teams patch mounts under fire and bring back shield emitters and gun mounts
    // shot away, and the flagship orders its line into formation. AI captains use the same commands by doctrine. There are no
    // bow, starboard, stern and port arcs and no angling the armour to one: everything fights in full 3D. The handling itself
    // (engine telegraph, steerage, keel, full 3D) is the capital flight model's (U.SPC-T499, docs/FLIGHT_MODELS.md); this
    // file is everything a captain does on top of it.
