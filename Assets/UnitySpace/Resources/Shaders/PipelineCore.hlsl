// share (com.unity.render-pipelines.core's SpaceTransforms.hlsl: TransformObjectToWorld, TransformWorldToHClip,
// TransformObjectToWorldNormal, ...) and GetCameraPositionWS(), so a pass is the same code on any pipeline.
//
// Each shader carries one SubShader per pipeline (U.SPC-T430), tagged with that pipeline's "RenderPipeline":
// the URP one includes this as it is, the HDRP one defines UNITYSPACE_PIPELINE_HDRP first. The library is
// chosen here, and so is how a fragment's colour reaches the image (PipelineExpose).
