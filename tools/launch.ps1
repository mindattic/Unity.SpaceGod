.SYNOPSIS
  Deploys the current build to C:\Apps\Unity.SpaceGod, then offers Normal Play, Demo +
  Capture, or Quit.
.DESCRIPTION
  Every menu choice launches muted by default (-muted and MINDATTIC_CLI_MUTED=1), Unity.Shared's
  session mute, so a CLI or agent launching the game for development never plays sound. Pass
  -Sound to launch with audio instead. The mute lasts for that run only and never touches the
  player's saved settings.json.
.PARAMETER Sound
  Launch with audio (no -muted, no MINDATTIC_CLI_MUTED).
.NOTES
  Always redeploys from source first (tools\run.ps1), so this never runs a stale build.
  Requires the Unity Editor closed for this project. Capture needs ffmpeg on PATH and the
  MindAttic.Capture library compiled in (see README.md).
